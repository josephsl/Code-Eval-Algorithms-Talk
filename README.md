# Code Eval Algorithms Talk

Code Eval (www.codeeval.com) is a website that allows developers to solve challenges and get a chance to be hired. The developer can use any programming language (popular ones being Python, C++ and so on).

Here you'll find algorithms that I used to solve Code Eval challenges. I decided to withhold the code in hopes of you solving it yourself.

## How did it all began...

I study computer science at UC Riverside. As part of our undergraduate course requirements, I'm taking algorithms. After talking to the instructor about class performance and understanding the materials, we agreed that it is better for me to understand the course content via coding.

While thinking about what problems to solve, a friend of mine (who has a Github account) tweeted that he solved a challenge at Code Eval. I decided to give Code Eval a try, and a week later (after solving some challenges), I've begun to appreciate some of the concepts covered in our algorithms course such as dynamic programming and graph algorithms.

## Intended audience

Anyone with a passion for programming and puzzles are welcome to study the material. If you are adventurous and are a person who wants to get some chances to getting a job, I highly encourage you to solve some challenges at Code Eval using the language you "speak" i.e. program such as C++.

Some solutions have "design notes" where I talk about why I chose a particular solution, with some containing some proofs.

Good luck.
